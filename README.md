### Welcome to my repositories 👋

It's pretty empty around here nowadays.

I've archived a lot of my repos because even though they had decent code, they were
mostly for my personal reference (e.g. snippets from when I was trying out other
programming languages, old college assignments and projects, club/department work,
etc.).

You can find these archived repos at:
  - https://gitlab.com/users/Hypro999/projects
  - https://gitlab.com/users/f20171170/projects

Don't forget to checkout my [gists](https://gist.github.com/Hypro999) too!
